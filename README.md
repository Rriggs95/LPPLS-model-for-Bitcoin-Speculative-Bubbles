# LPPLS-model-for-Bitcoin-Speculative-Bubbles
This code uses the lppls module for python, developed by [Boulder-Investment-Technologies](https://github.com/Boulder-Investment-Technologies/lppls), to calculate the confidence indicators for specualtive bubbles. The package however is currently not functional on python 3.10 due to incompatibilities between the numba and numpy modules.
